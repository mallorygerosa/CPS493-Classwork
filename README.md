I’ve been a computer science major ever since I started college in 2018, but I recently switched to computer engineering to try out more in depth classes on hardware. Basically, it's likely that one will be my major, and one will be my minor, I just haven’t decided yet. Between 2017 and 2020, I only had the chance to work with Java and a little bit of C++ in my classes at New Paltz in my CS1-3 and assembly language classes, and I've recently started learning HTML and CSS before this class started. This summer, I worked only with C++ in a software engineering class, in which which I worked on a number of complex algorithm based programs and an SFML based game of Tetris that I made with some of my classmates, which is available in a shared repository on my GitHub. As for IDEs, I've worked with Sublime, jGrasp, and a little bit of Xcode.

I want to take this class so I can work independently on creating and maintaining websites and apps, both on a personal and professional level. I have a number of friends who’d like help setting up a small platform for a blog or shop, and I'd like to make a website for my photography portfolio.  I'm interested in learning front end development since I'm not familiar with it, and in the future, I’d like to try programming apps and more complex websites to have some flexibility in my abilities. I’d like to apply these skills personally and professionally, since I know there’s a lot of opportunities either way.

I took a leave of absence a few weeks before the school was closed due to Covid, but I returned this summer and took three courses at Boston University. I’m comfortable with picking up new coding languages, but I’m a little rusty with picking up new IDEs/frameworks. W3Schools is very helpful on its own, but I’d appreciate any suggestions for extra resources.
